                <p> The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems, offering dual-core
                    processing, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and a rich set of peripherals. This
                    microcontroller is widely used in IoT projects, wearables, and industrial applications due to its
                    low
                    power consumption, secure features, and active developer community.</p>

                <p>The DHT11 is a cost-effective temperature and humidity sensor frequently used in electronics
                    projects. It provides accurate readings within a specific range, making it suitable for climate
                    control in
                    home automation, weather stations, and environmental monitoring. With a simple digital interface,
                    it's
                    easy to use with microcontrollers and Arduino boards, making it popular in DIY applications.

                <p>The Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), also known as a photoresistor, is a passive electronic
                    component that changes its resistance in response to varying light levels. As light intensity
                    increases,
                    the resistance decreases. LDRs are commonly used in light-sensing applications, such as
                    streetlights,
                    cameras, and automatic lighting systems. They are cost-effective and easy to interface with
                    microcontrollers, making them a popular choice for projects requiring light detection and control
